                    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
                    <p>To abstract the problem of the 15-puzzle to one that
                    can be solved with a computer, I mapped the board
                    states to a graph. Each node in the graph represents
                    a given board state, and the goal node is a solved board.</p>
                    <h2>A* (A star)</h2>
                    <p>The first graph traversal algorithm I used to solve
                    the 15 puzzle was 

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">
                        A*</a>, which is a variation of 

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">
                        Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> 

                    that uses a <strong>heuristic</strong> to prioritize nodes
                    that are closer to the goal state. I used a heuristic called
                    Manhattan distance, which calculates the distance of each
                    tile from its location on a solved board to estimate the
                    number of moves needed to solve that state. Additionally,
                    I wrote a function to calculate linear conflict, which
                    detects when two tiles are in a row or column but
                    permuted incorrectly (their positioning is "switched"),
                    but it actually slowed down the A* and IDA* algorithms because
                    of the tie it took to calculate, so while the function is 
                    included in the 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Professor-L/fifteen-puzzle">
                            source code
                        </a> 
                    on GitHub, the A* function itself does not utilize it.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Iterative Deepening A*</h2>
                    
                    <p>The second algorithm used, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*">IDA*</a>, is faster because while it doesn't store already searched nodes and thus searches some board states morethan once, it stores much less in memory. At its heart, IDA* is simply a depth-first search that uses a heuristic and a g-score to optimize the order in which branches of the tree are searched.</p>

                <p>I'm Professor L, and this is my creation. I'm seventeen,
                    I've been programming for about two years, and this is 
                    my first experience with graph traversal algorithms 
                    (hence the use of JavaScript rather than a lower level
                    language like C). I'm pretty sure I'm contractually 
                    obligated to link 
                    <a href="https://github.com/professor-l">

                    </a>
                    , so there's that. I take an interest in music too,
                    so I'll link 
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/professor_l">

                    can donate to my "cause." I spend a subtantial portion
                    of my free time programming in lou of getting a 
                    part-time job, so financial assistance is much 
                    appreciated. College in the States is expensive.
